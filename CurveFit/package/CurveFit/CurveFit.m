(* :Summary:
This package provides tools to visualize, manipulate, and fit 
two-dimensional data with some chosen function. The data may 
have errors on both variables (x,y). *)

              CurveFit for Mathematica v7.x thru v10.x
                    F. Rice, Pasadena, CA
1.95 (1/2016): Works with the updated ErrorBarLogPlots 3.0, so that it now 
works with Mathematica 10.x. Increased default error bar thickness to Medium

1.91 (1/2015): Check for Mathematica v10 and abort package install. Changed
example in "Fit any function.nb" to fit decaying sinusoid. Commented out 
load of PlotLegends package in Plots.m.

1.9 (3/2014): Added scatter plot function for Compton scattering
experiment data files (x channel v. y channel).

1.8 (1/2014): Fixed problem with some dialog boxes appearing too
large with certain laptop monitor display aspect ratios.

1.7 (1/2013): Added several algebraic manipulations to the Transform
sub-palette.

1.6 (5/2012): Added LoadTekFile[]. Removed "E" default comment delimiter.
Fixed file load error message if there is no file header.

1.5 (12/2011): Various fixes and tweaks. Significant expansion of the
interactive loading and manipulation of data sets and the undo stack.

1.4 (5/2009): Fixed problem with MakePoisson[] on unsorted data.
Added SortData[].

1.3 (3/2009): Added data manipulations for gamma ray spectra.
Changed exponential fits so that non-positive Y values don't
abort the fits. Added capability to input USB-20 .tsv files.

1.2 (1/2009): Added resonance phase fit. Many palette cosmetic
changes. Removed RC filter fits, as they seem buggy. Miscellaneous 
minor improvements.

1.1 (3/2008): Included input parsing for Spectrum Techniques .TSV 
gamma-ray spectrum files, as well as enhancements for processing
multichannel analyzer count data. Some other minor improvements.

1.0 (1/2008): First port of CurveFit to Mathematica v6.x. 
Incorporated several enhancements over CurveFit for Mathematica 5.

(*
                CurveFit written by A. Vayonakis 
	           Initial code was written in Nov. 97

Additions/modifications made on 12/11/07:
Fixed syntax problems with the use of Compile[] in the fitting 
function definitions. No more errors with Mathematica 5, and 
much faster fitting.

Additions/modifications made on 1/25/06:
Replaced the Block with the ReadList function in the LoadFile 
functions, with Import (needs v .4).  Reading large files 
should be much faster.

Additions/modifications made on 2/27/03:
Changed the LoadFile code to be more robust: 
Now, a line whos first non-empty character is any of the user 
chosen delimiters: {"E", "S", etc.}, will be ingored. Also, 
made a separate palette for more options loading the data (eg. 
to have separate button for the E option: selecting 
combinations of columns to define the data.) Added 
MagSecondOrderLowPassFilter, which is has the same functional 
format with resonance curve (N), but with different variable 
definitions.  

Additions/modifications made on 2/25/03:
Added 1st order low-pass, and 1st order high-pass (2nd order 
low-pass filters can use resonance curve (N)) for ph3.
  
Previous additions/modifications were made on 6/06/00.
